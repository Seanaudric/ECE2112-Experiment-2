# ECE2112-Experiment-2

This repository is for the Experiment 2 of my ECE2112 - Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms course. The notebook uploaded contains Python codes that deal with different sample problems given, which consist of:

NORMALIZATION PROBLEM - Where we were tasked to create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X, and then normalize X.

DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM - Where we were tasked to create a 10 x 10 ndarray, which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers and then determine all the elements that are divisible by 3.
